# TLDR - A Historical TLD Records Archive
This repository is updated every few hours with the results from [DNS zone transfer attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer) again the [root nameservers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server) and all existing TLD servers. This is done to keep record of zone files for various TLDs and to monitor how these zones change overtime.
